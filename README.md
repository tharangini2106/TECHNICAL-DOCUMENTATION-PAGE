programming languages documentation

The Technical Documentation refers to the documents that interpret the use, functionality, creation of the structure of the product and services. For Example, Think of an electronic product such as “a how-to guide for” your users, new hires, administrators and anyone else who wants to know how the product works. The process sounds pretty straightforward, but the result hardly is somewhat like that. Technical documentation is the guide for anyone who wants to know detailed info about the product.Likewise Here I would created a Programming languages documentation page.
